# Causation: Properties and the Laws of Nature

To be honest, I really struggled with the title. There are quite a few topics covered here, all of them are interconnected somehow, but which one is central? Finally, I came up with the one you see right now. This post is about causation, and there are two major views on that. Both of those views stand upon two major topics: properties and the laws of nature.

## Categorical and Dispositional properties
### Categorical properties
There is an apple in front of me right now. It's red. This property, "being red", describes this apple as it really is, not as it could be upon some conditions. This kind of properties is called categorical.

Now consider two billiard balls. They are at the table, lying still. "Being still" is a categorical property. Now imagine that they collide. What would happen? Your experience probably tells you that they would bounce away, which is, most probably, true. But why is it so? If you're all into categorical properties, you would like to explain this behavior through the way those balls are. Your best bet might be to appeal to the specific way its molecular structure is. Categoricalist naturally prefers descriptive vocabulary instead of prescriptive. For example, categoricalist won't say that the balls are bouncy. This phrase implies that they _need_ to bounce away when colliding. It implies a necessary causation: if the balls collide, they will bounce away. They simply don't have other options.

And what if those balls have never collided so far, and never will? Then "being bouncy" does not describe the world as it is. Instead, it describes it as it could be upon specific conditions. In other words, it's not a categorical property. What is it then?

### Dispositional properties
#### Causation
From the old days, people were preoccupied with different variations of a simple question: "What caused it to be the way it is?". Like, "Why do I always get sick when I go hunting a mammoth wearing only a tee-shirt in winter?" or "Why do I always get better if I drink hot water and lie in my bed for a couple of days?". In other words, people have always been interested in causation.

Cause is a change (typically some action or event) sufficient for some event to take place. Throwing a stone at the window is often sufficient for it to get broken. Broken window is an effect caused by throwing a stone. The relation between those two event - "Stone was thrown" and "Window was broken" - is called a causation relation. It's a metaphysical way of saying "If I throw the stone at that window, it will break".
