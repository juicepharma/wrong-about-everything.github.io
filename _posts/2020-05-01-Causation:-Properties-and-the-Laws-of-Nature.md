# Causation: Properties and the Laws of Nature

To be honest, I really struggled with the title. There are quite a few topics covered here, all of them are interconnected somehow, but which one is central? Finally, I came up with the one you see above. This post is about causation, and there are two major views on that. Both of those views stand upon two major topics: properties and the laws of nature.

## Categorical and Dispositional properties
### Categorical properties
There is an apple in front of me right now. It's red. This property, "being red", describes this apple as it really is, not as it could be upon some conditions. This kind of properties is called categorical.

Now consider two billiard balls. They are at the table, lying still. "Being still" is a categorical property. Now imagine that they collide. What would happen? Your experience probably tells you that they would bounce away, which is, most probably, true. But why is it so? If you're all into categorical properties, you would like to explain this behavior through the way those balls are. Your best bet might be to appeal to the specific way its molecular structure is. Categoricalist naturally prefers descriptive vocabulary instead of prescriptive. For example, categoricalist won't say that the balls are bouncy. This phrase implies that they _need_ to bounce away when colliding. It implies a necessary causation: if the balls collide, they will bounce away. They simply don't have other options.

And what if those balls have never collided so far, and never will? Then "being bouncy" does not describe the world as it is. Instead, it describes it as it could be upon specific conditions. In other words, it's not a categorical property. What is it then?

### Dispositional properties
#### Causation
From the old days, people were preoccupied with different variations of a simple question: "What caused it to be the way it is?". Like, "Why do I always get sick when I go hunting a mammoth wearing only a tee-shirt in winter?" or "Why do I always get better if I drink hot water and lie in my bed for a couple of days?". In other words, people have always been interested in causation.

Cause is a change (typically some action or event) sufficient for some event to take place. Throwing a stone at the window is often sufficient for it to get broken. Broken window is an effect caused by throwing a stone. The relation between those two event - "Stone was thrown" and "Window was broken" - is called a causation relation. It's a metaphysical way of saying "If I throw the stone at that window, it will break".

#### Dispositions
Dispositions are properties describing how something could be. Proposition "this vase is fragile" tells us that under standard conditions, this vase will shatter if it drops on the floor. When dispositional properties are considered, it's arguably more convenient to view cause as an action:

![Cause activates dispositional property, effect is a manifested property](/images/causation/cause_activates_dispositional_property_effect_is_a_manifested_property.jpg)

For example, if I drop a vase, it will shatter:

![If I drop a vase, it will shatter](/images/causation/if_i_drop_a_vase_it_will_shatter.jpg)

If I consider a fragility of a vase as a ground for a causal relation, I use an event as a [relatum](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/relatum):

![Vase was dropped on the floor, hence shattered](/images/causation/vase_was_dropped_on_the_floor.jpg)

Dispositionalists assume that dispositional properties are fundamental. That is, there are no categorical properties that ground them.

## Inductive Reasoning and the Uniformity Principle
Let's start out with an example of inductive reasoning. Suppose that I've approached my neighbor's dog, Rex, a week ago. I wasn't sure what to expect of him, but luckily, he hasn't bitten me, and I've petted him. So my initial hypothesis was that Rex was friendly. The next day I did the same. And the next day too. Have been doing it for  several days in a row, collecting more and more evidence, I strengthened my initial belief about the dog's temper. I presuppose that the future will resemble the past and the present, a principle called "the Uniformity Principle", and right now I can infer the following: "The next time I approach Rex I'll stay safe". In the same vein, I can make the general claim: "Rex is friendly".

The dog might have been reacting aggressively all along; then I should have adjusted my beliefs about him accordingly. And that's the essence of inductive reasoning: new relevant evidence affects my current beliefs, serving either as a testimony or a counter-argument; and this belief is a basis that grounds my considerations about the future.

### Inductive argument
The [argument](https://www.iep.utm.edu/argument/) about Rex can look like "I've been petting that dog for several days in a row, and he hasn't ever bitten me. Thus, the dog is friendly". It's an inductive argument, since the premise - "I've been petting that dog for several days in a row" - doesn't provide _total_ support for the truth of a conclusion. For example, the dog might have been sick, hence the apathy have been taken for friendliness.

Compare it with a deductive argument:
 - Premise 1: if it's raining now, I'll take an umbrella.  
 - Premise 2: it's raining now.  
 - Conclusion: I'll take an umbrella.  
Its premises logically entail the truth of the conclusion, which is not the case for an inductive argument.

### The problem of induction
Induction is great, we rely on it and often it serves us well. Scientific research, trials - they are all about induction. But here is a kicker: it seems that there is no way to prove that it works.

Let's consider a [simple induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#Simple_induction), a typical inductive argument:

> Premise: All observed instances of A have been B.
> Conclusion: The next instance of A will be B.

Let's call this inductive argument _I_.

Here's a simplified version of an argument that David Hume, a Scottish philosopher, laid out in "[A Treatise of Human Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treatise_of_Human_Nature)":

**Premise 1**: there are only two kinds of arguments: inductive and deductive.  
**Premise 2**: inductive argument I presupposes the Uniformity Principle.

**Premise 3**: a deductive argument has a conclusion which is necessarily true - by definition. Its denial is a contradiction.  
**Premise 4**: the negation of the Uniformity Principle is not a contradiction - we can't know for sure what the future brings.  
**Conclusion 1**: there is no deductive argument for the Uniformity Principle (from Premise 3 and Premise 4)

**Conclusion 2**: since there is no deductive argument for the Uniformity Principle (Conclusion 1), any argument for the Uniformity Principle, if present at all, can be only inductive (Premise 1).  
**Conclusion 3**: since any inductive argument presupposes the Uniformity Principle (Premise 2), any argument (Conclusion 2) for it presupposes the Uniformity Principle.  
**Premise 5**: an argument for a principle can't presuppose the same principle.  
**Conclusion 4**: there is no argument for the Uniformity Principle.

**Conclusion 5**: since there is no argument for the Uniformity Principle, we can't use it for justification of any inference that presupposes the Uniformity Principle.  
**Conclusion 6**: inductive inference I is not justified.

There are a lot of attempts to solve this problem, and each of them has its pros and cons. The problem of induction is a primary cornerstone dividing people in their views on causation.

## Laws of Nature
### Laws of Science vs Laws of Nature
There are a lot of laws discovered by scientists. Some of them are seemingly simple, but not so accurate, or limited to a narrow set of cases. Others are more complicated, but work in a wider spectrum of cases. Generally, a law of science is an approximation good enough for solving specific problems. Take [Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law). The formula in its simplest linear form works either for ideal springs or for very stiff materials like glass. A general form of Hooke's law looks way more complex, but it's more universal: it works for more materials.

Laws of Nature are approximations with the best combination of simplicity, accuracy and generality. We consider such laws to be the most fundamental ones, which ground most of other laws. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law) has some good  examples of scientific  laws which can claim to be the Laws of Nature.

### Two principal views of the Laws of Nature
In Regularity Theory, Laws of Nature are just descriptions of repetitive patterns of the world. In this view, nothing _must_ be the way it is. It just _is_. It's not necessary for the Sun to rise again tomorrow morning, because the Uniformity Principle is not justified and inductive reasoning doesn't work. Anyway, if the Sun  does rise -  great, our current understanding of the World will not change. If it doesn't, the Laws of Nature will have to be adjusted accordingly.

In Necessitarianism, on the other hand, the Laws of Nature govern the World, and it obeys. Those laws can't fail. There is no way for the World to escape those laws. Another name for this hopeless relation is "physical necessity".

There are two different kinds of this necessity. From the Nomists point of view, this relation is [external](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relations/), that is, it's independent of objects' properties; in other words, it's not fixed by its properties. For example, the fact that  I'm ten meters away from some tree is not defined by [intrinsic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intrinsic-extrinsic/) properties of mine. From this perspective, an electron repels other electrons because there is an external guidance that makes them act the certain way. On the contrary, from the Powerist view, an electron repels other electrons because of an intrinsic dispositional property, namely "repelling other electrons". Thus, in Powerism, the Laws of Nature are grounded in dispositional properties.
