There are things, and there are ways those things are. Those "ways" are called attributes, traits, characteristics, or properties. Are those properties distinct entities, like my mobile phone or an apple in your refrigerator? Or are they just a way we talk or think of things?

In this humble introduction, we'll first consider a view that rejects properties as such. After that, we'll review some reasons for postulating properties and take a glimpse of what they look like. And finally, we'll discover two major views on what it means to have a property: Realism and Nominalism.

## There are no properties as distinct entities
### Predicate Nominalism
In this view, there are red apples and red firetrucks, but there is no such distinct thing as redness. Predicate nominalists say that introducing this entity doesn't bring much at the table. It doesn't add anything to explanation why an apple is red. With physics, we can explain an apple's redness with the specific way its peel reflects light. This is apparently because of a specific molecular structure it has. But the question is still open: why does the specific molecular structure reflect light exactly the way it does? In metaphysical lingo, this question typically goes like that: what grounds this behavior? Or, in other words, in virtue of what is this the case? We can say that it's because an apple possesses a property "being such that it reflects light in a way that most humans perceive it as red", but this is not very different if we take that an apple is red as a brute fact, simply because we can use a predicate "is red" with a subject "an apple".

### Problems with Predicate Nominalism
First, it seems that Predicate Nominalists try to explain things the other way round. Instead of trying to find out what is it which makes an apple red, they posit quite the opposite: if they can say that it's red, well, then it's red. That smells unscientific. Besides, what if there were no humans in the World? Red apples wouldn't cease to exist, but there would be nothing we could explain their redness with. That the reason why Predicate Nominalism is often referred disparagingly as Ostrich Nominalism.

Besides, the world ontology becomes bloated. Since redness is not shared among all the red apples, we can't say that some single entity grounds similarity. Instead, each similarity of each red apple pair is metaphysically unique.

![Unique resemblances in Predicate Nominalism](/images/properties/unique_resemblances_in_predicate_nominalism.jpg)
<figcaption>Unique resemblances in Predicate Nominalism</figcaption>

That is, the similarity of my red apples is different from the similarity of your red apples. Generally, if there are N apples, there are N × (N - 1) / 2 metaphysically unique [dyadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic) ([binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation)) relations.

![Number of unique resemblances in predicate nominalism](/images/properties/number_of_unique_resemblances_in_predicate_nominalism.jpg)
<figcaption>Number of unique resemblances in Predicate Nominalism</figcaption>

The goal of metaphysical ontology is parsimony, and with Predicate Nominalism, we're way too far from that. Probably introducing properties as distinct entities is not such a bad idea. Let's see what problems we can solve with them.

## OK, let's say properties exist. Why?
### Properties ground similarity

One of the reasons to introduce property as a distinct metaphysical entity results from the previous section. If we introduce a distinct RED-ness entity, we can say that two apples are red in virtue of *sharing a single property*. Both apples *exemplify* a single property, that's why they are similar.

![Apples are similar in virtue of sharing a single redness property](/images/properties/apples_are_similar_in_virtue_of_sharing_the_redness_property.jpg)
<figcaption>Apples are similar in virtue of sharing a single redness property</figcaption>

### Properties can give a semantic account of a natural language: general terms, predicates, and abstract singular terms
In the philosophy of language, we can explain the literal meaning of a general term by claiming that it expresses a property. For example, we can explain the meaning of “red” with the fact that it expresses, or designates, or [denotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotation), a property “redness”. In other words, “redness” property is a specific thing to which the concept of “red” general term applies.

!["red" general term denotes property "redness"](/images/properties/red_general_term_denotes_property_redness.jpg)
<figcaption>"red" general term denotes property "redness"</figcaption>

In the same vein, we can introduce a property so that it can be denoted by a predicate. For example, a predicate "is red" from a sentence "This apple is red" denotes a "redness" property. And if this sentence is true, is there anything which that property denotes? Sure, in this case, it can be applied to that apple. In the philosophy of language, they say that it is in the [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(semantics)) of that property, which, in turn, is in the extension of a predicate "is red". Going in the opposite direction, "redness" property is an intension of all red apples, and "is red" predicate is an intension of a "redness" property.

!["is red" predicate denotes "redness" property which denotes all the red apples](/images/properties/is_red_predicate_denotes_redness_property_which_denotes_all_the_red_apples.jpg)
<figcaption>"is red" predicate denotes "redness" property which denotes all the red apples</figcaption>

Abstract singular terms, like "honesty" or "redness", denote the same property that the associated predicate does. In our case, an associated predicate for "honesty" is "is honest", for "red" it's "is red". "Honesty is a virtue" is true when "honesty" denotes a property that is in the extension of the property denoted by a predicate "is a virtue".

!["Honesty" property expressed by "honesty" singular term is in the extension of the "virtue" property](/images/properties/honesty_property_expressed_by_honesty_singular_term_is_in_the_extension_of_the_virtue_property.jpg)
<figcaption>"Honesty" property expressed by "honesty" singular term is in the extension of the "virtue" property</figcaption>

Pretty much any predicate can be nominalized the way I've outlined above. So if we accept that properties can give semantic values to predicates, they do the same to abstract singular terms and general terms as a free lunch.

<figcaption>An abstract singular term, a predicate, and a general term denoting the same property which denotes concrete objects</figcaption>

## What do properties look like?
There are different accounts of what it is to be a property, and they look differently according to each of those explanations.

If there are two red apples, both of them have the property of “being red”. In this case, metaphysicians say that this property is multiply located, or repeatable: it can inhere in multiple objects, thus be present in different places at the same time. Just like redness is present in many apples at the same time.

Properties can be thought of as being out of space and time. They can’t be identified spatiotemporally. You can’t say where redness was last Tuesday. In this view, a property is called a transcendent entity.

In a natural language, properties often take a form of predicates. Consider the following sentences: This apple *is red*; I *am married to my wife*; My sister *is in the park*; I *am sitting*; I *am tired* — predicates are marked italic, and all of them characterize a subject somehow. Hence, they can qualify as referring to properties. It follows that properties are identical if corresponding predicates are identical.

Properties are not perceptible by any of our five senses. Hotness itself is not hot, it’s a cup of coffee which is hot. Redness probably isn’t red either, it’s an apple which is red. In this view, properties are though as causally inert, which means that you can’t interact with them; instead, you can interact with objects possessing them.

Now we know what properties are for, that is what problems they solve, and we have some idea about how they might look like. Next, we can take a closer look at what makes properties identical.

## Identity conditions
Once again, there are different views on what are properties, hence there are different views on what it is for properties to be identical.

If you take a look at the image where properties give a semantic account to a natural language, probably the most obvious candidate for grounding properties’ identity is their extension. This account is unsurprisingly known as an extensional criterion: if extensions of two properties are the same, then those properties are identical. In other words, there is just one property, not two. But what if each object in the Universe having a property of A, has a property of B either? What makes those properties different? This problem is known as the problem of accidental coextension and will be mentioned further. But now, it seems that a finer-grained approach is required.

We can conclude this account by looking at the same picture. If properties’ extensions coincide, their predicated don’t. Having a heart is distinct from having kidneys because those two correspond to distinct predicates. This approach works out even if all the living organisms having a heart, have kidneys, that is if the extension of those properties is the same. But isn’t it too fine-grained? In this view, *being red and sweet* is still different from *being sweet and red*, which doesn’t seem plausible. Since predicates, which are properties’ intensions, are the basis of identity in this account, it’s called a hyperintensional criterion.

[Dispositionalism](https://wrong-about-everything.github.io/Causation-Properties-and-the-Laws-of-Nature/) view provides a middle ground between coarse-grained extensional criterion and fine-grained hyperintensional criterion. We can identify a property by a pair of cause and effect. For example, what is it to have a mass of one kilogram? We can identify it as something which grounds the ability of an object possessing this property to accelerate at 1 m/s<sup>2</sup> when a force of one Newton is applied.

But what if you pursue a categorical account? For you, properties are not what something *could* be, but what something is. Thus, properties can't be identified by causal relations. Instead, they should possess some unique identifier which makes a property to just be that property. This intrinsic qualitative nature is called quiddity. It's sort of primitive such-and-such-ness. To be honest, when I first encountered this concept, I thought that it was too much for me. It's too mysterious, and even now, I have difficulties conjuring it up. How can we even know them? Philosophically speaking, quiddities have serious epistemic challenges.

OK, let's move on and take a look at properties population.

## How many properties are there?
There are four views on this question. The first one, Minimalism, implies that there are very few fundamental properties. In a well-established metaphysical terminology, they say that the realm of properties is sparse. The most prominent candidates for such properties are the ones from physics, like spin and charge of quarks, opposing to being red and being sweet. We can employ two strategies to deal with the latter. The first option is to accept their existence, but in this case, we must claim that such properties are not fundamental and supervene on those which are. To put it differently, non-fundamental properties are ontologically determined by the fundamental ones. The second option is to reject their existence, claiming that they are not distinct metaphysical entities, but linguistic or conceptual ones.

The second view is to accept that all the possible properties exist, both fundamental and non-fundamental: *consisting of molecules*, *having a mass*, *having a mass of 7 grammes*, *having a mass of 96 kilogrammes*, etc. Some accounts endorse even impossible properties, like *being a square circle* or *being bitten by a dinosaur last Thursday*. This account is called Maximalism, where, as metaphysicians say, properties constitute an abundant realm and thus follow a principle of plenitude. It’s ontologically bloated indeed, but it’s more explanatory powerful: there is a property for any possible predicate. Thus, all predicates have a semantic value. Besides, the Maximalist account is epistemically controversial. On the one hand, natural properties like being red are easy to find — as easy as identifying a predicate in a sentence, actually. On the other, non-existent properties like *being bitten by a dinosaur last Thursday* can’t be ever discovered by definition.

It's tempting to take a middle ground view, and that's what Centrism aims at. But a criterion of which properties are allowed and which are not is surprisingly hard to formulate. There are many positions, and there is no consensus.

The fourth view called Dualism postulates that we can choose granularity depending on the task at hand. If we’re talking about linguistics and semantics, we can take fine-grained properties denoted by predicates. In Dualism, they are called type I properties. If we’re up to naturalistic ontology, our properties can be coarser-grained: property of *having a horn and hooves* is identical to *having hooves and a horn*. They are called type II properties. By far, it seems to be the most viable option.

Now as we already know how properties look like, how they can be individuated, and how many of them there are, we can consider different classifications of properties.

## What properties are there?
I'll give just a brief account of each classification, skipping the problem parts. You can find links to more in-depth articles at the end of this post.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic properties
There is an apple in front of me. It's red, sweet, and weights about 200 grams. Besides, it's lying on the edge of a table, has traveled from China, and was bought at the corner shop. Both statements represent an apple's properties, but they seem different. Properties from the former statement obtain because of an apple itself, because of its nature, independent of anything else. That apple would be red, sweet, and weight about 200 grams even if nothing except that apple existed. But properties from the latter exist because of something else: other objects and relations with them. An apple lying on the edge of a table is because of a table and an apple holding a specific relation with it; the property of having traveled from China seems to exist because of China's existence and an apple's relation to it; and so does a property of having bought at the corner shop. The first kind of properties is called intrinsic, the second one is extrinsic, or relational.

### Accidental and essential properties
I have a property of being a human. I can't lack this property. If I had lacked it though, an object I refer to as "I" wouldn't exist. On the other hand, right now I'm wearing a tee-shirt with Deadpool. If I had put another tee-shirt on this morning, I'd stay the same person.

I'll give just a brief account of each classification, skipping the problem parts. You can find links to more in-depth articles at the end of this post.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic properties
There is an apple in front of me. It's red, sweet, and weights about 200 grams. Besides, it's lying on the edge of a table, has traveled from China, and was bought at the corner shop. Both statements represent an apple's properties, but they seem different. Properties from the former statement obtain because of an apple itself, because of its nature, independent of anything else. That apple would be red, sweet, and weight about 200 grams even if nothing except that apple existed. But properties from the latter exist because of something else: other objects and relations with them. An apple lying on the edge of a table is because of a table and an apple holding a specific relation with it; the property of having traveled from China seems to exist because of China's existence and an apple's relation to it; and so does a property of having bought at the corner shop. The first kind of properties is called intrinsic, the second one is extrinsic, or relational.

### Accidental and essential properties
I have a property of being a human. I can't lack this property. If I had lacked it though, an object I refer to as "I" wouldn't exist. On the other hand, right now I'm wearing a tee-shirt with Deadpool. If I had put another tee-shirt on this morning, I'd stay the same person.

It seems that there are properties that an object must have to reinforce its existence. Those properties are called essential. Some philosophical accounts claim that a bunch of essential properties form a distinct metaphysical entity called natural kind. It is a type of object; some philosophers claim that it is a property itself. Consider the following properties: having a charge of −1.6×10<sup>−19</sup> C, having a mass of 9.1×10<sup>−31</sup> kg, and having a spin of 1/2. Does it remind you of anything? Correct, those are properties of an electron. So together they form a concept “electron”. So if we find some object which has those properties, we can say that it is an electron. It can have other properties as well, and they can very well be different from other electrons’ ones. But those properties are not essential to electron, they don’t make electron what it is. They are just accidental. But if some object lacks only one of the properties essential to electron, then it is not an electron. Natural kinds are abstractions in this regard: they only keep the essential and sweep away everything else.

### Determinable and determinate properties
Property of being honest is a specific case of having a virtue. Property of being red is a specific case of being coloured. The former are called determinate properties, while the latter are determinable. The same property can be a determinate in one context, and determinable in another. For example, being red is determinable relative to being crimson; but it’s determinate relative to being coloured. Usually, all the determinate properties exclude each other. Just like a natural kind is a sum of all distinct objects falling under it, determinable property is, roughly, a disjunction of all determinate ones.

Determinate properties seem to be more fundamental; they make determinable property to be what it is. Hence, in the Minimalism account, only determinate properties exist; and determinables reduce to determinate. Determinable ones are sort of useful fictions that we humans use colloquially. Strict hierarchy in a perfectly determinate world without any metaphysical vagueness is appealing indeed.

In the Maximalism account, the entire rich stock of all kinds of properties exists.

### Relations
Extrinsic properties seem to obtain in virtue of relation. For example, an apple lying on the edge of a table is a relational property which holds in virtue of a relation between an apple and that table. Some say that those relations are itself properties, some say that it’s a means for instantiating properties. It might (and I bet it does) sound elusive right now. Don’t worry, I’ll go in more detail about it a bit later.

### Categorical Properties and Causal Powers
I’ve already covered this topic in [greater detail](https://wrong-about-everything.github.io/Causation-Properties-and-the-Laws-of-Nature/), so I’ll just outline the basics here.

There are ways objects are: some object is triangular-shaped, has a side equal to 85 cm, is red, and lies on the table. Those kinds of properties are called categorical.

Likewise, there are ways objects could be. Those ways manifest under certain circumstances, and those circumstances can never happen. That vase is fragile — it means, it shatters if thrown on the floor. In this case, a property of being fragile confers a power of shattering on a vase. Sometimes, those powers are the only ways we can comprehend properties. Another example is a charge of an electron: the only way we can know it is the way it interacts with other charged objects. Does it repel or attract other electrons? And what about protons? This view of properties is called dispositional. The overall approach when objects’ properties are defined by the way they interact with other objects is known as Structuralism.

Some philosophers claim that there are only categorical properties, some say otherwise, that there are only dispositional ones. Others try to find some middle ground: either by claiming that some properties are categorical and some dispositional, or arguing that all the properties are both categorical and dispositional.

OK, now it’s time to dive a bit deeper and consider what properties are. There are two general views on that subject: Realism and Nominalism. Put your seat belt on: dark, dense metaphysics ahead.

## Realism
Generally, realism is a view that accepts that Universals exist. Part of realists agrees that they ground objects' character. But the concept of Universal means different things in different Realism branches. Here, I'll consider two of them: Platonism and Immanent Realism. The first one has its roots in Plato's views which are now known as Extreme Realism, and the second one traces back to Aristotle's views, which collectively go under Strong Realism label.

### Platonism
Platonism is arguably a contemporary version of Plato’s views, though it’s not completely clear what Plato meant when described his views. We can say that both views postulate the existence of a transcendent entity which is out of space and time: you can’t see it, you can’t touch it, you can’t interact with it in any way (metaphysical way of saying it is that they are [causally inert](https://wrong-about-everything.github.io/Causation-Properties-and-the-Laws-of-Nature/)). This entity is called a Universal.
