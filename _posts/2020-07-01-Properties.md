There are things, and there are ways those things are. Those "ways" are called attributes, traits, characteristics, or properties. Are those properties distinct entities, like my mobile phone or an apple in your refrigerator? Or are they just a way we talk or think of things?

In this humble introduction, we'll first consider a view that rejects properties as such. After that, we'll review some reasons for postulating properties and take a glimpse of what they look like. And finally, we'll discover two major views on what it means to have a property: Realism and Nominalism.

## There are no properties as distinct entities
### Predicate Nominalism
In this view, there are red apples and red firetrucks, but there is no such distinct thing as redness. Predicate nominalists say that introducing this entity doesn't bring much at the table. It doesn't add anything to explanation why an apple is red. With physics, we can explain an apple's redness with the specific way its peel reflects light. This is apparently because of a specific molecular structure it has. But the question is still open: why does the specific molecular structure reflect light exactly the way it does? In metaphysical lingo, this question typically goes like that: what grounds this behavior? Or, in other words, in virtue of what is this the case? We can say that it's because an apple possesses a property "being such that it reflects light in a way that most humans perceive it as red", but this is not very different if we take that an apple is red as a brute fact, simply because we can use a predicate "is red" with a subject "an apple".

### Problems with Predicate Nominalism
First, it seems that Predicate Nominalists try to explain things the other way round. Instead of trying to find out what is it which makes an apple red, they posit quite the opposite: if they can say that it's red, well, then it's red. That smells unscientific. Besides, what if there were no humans in the World? Red apples wouldn't cease to exist, but there would be nothing we could explain their redness with. That the reason why Predicate Nominalism is often referred disparagingly as Ostrich Nominalism.

Besides, the world ontology becomes bloated. Since redness is not shared among all the red apples, we can't say that some single entity grounds similarity. Instead, each similarity of each red apple pair is metaphysically unique.

That is, the similarity of my red apples is different from the similarity of your red apples. Generally, if there are N apples, there are N × (N - 1) / 2 metaphysically unique [dyadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic) ([binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation)) relations.
