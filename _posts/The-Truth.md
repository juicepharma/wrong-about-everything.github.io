## The Question
There are multiple ways I can start my metaphysical endeavor. The main problem here is to organize the narrative in such a way that I don't refer to things I haven't yet mentioned. With that in mind, let's start with a seemingly simple question: what is the truth?

## The Correspondence Theory of Truth
Right now, on November 19, 2019, at 8:54 am, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm drinking an overwhelmingly nice cup of flat white. I can write the following sentence: "I'm drinking a cup of flat white", and it is true because I'm actually doing this.

This intuitive understanding of the truth dates back to Aristotle who posited it like the following:

> A sentence is true if the world is the way the sentence says, and false, if the world is not the way the sentence says.

This view is called [the Correspondence Theory of Truth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/).
