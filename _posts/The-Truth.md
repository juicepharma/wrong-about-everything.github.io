## The Question
There are multiple ways I can start my metaphysical endeavor. The main problem here is to organize the narrative in such a way that I don't refer to things I haven't yet mentioned. With that in mind, let's start with a seemingly simple question: what is the truth?

## The Correspondence Theory of Truth
Right now, on November 19, 2019, at 8:54 am, as I'm writing this sentence, I'm drinking an overwhelmingly nice cup of flat white. I can write the following sentence: "I'm drinking a cup of flat white", and it is true because I'm actually doing this.

This intuitive understanding of the truth dates back to Aristotle who posited it like the following:

> A sentence is true if the world is the way the sentence says, and false, if the world is not the way the sentenceÂ says.

This view is called [the Correspondence Theory of Truth](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/).

Correspondence is a relation, namely the relation between two things: a sentence or thought, and the way the world is. This relation is just a formal way to indicate that the world is the way a sentence says. When this relation exists, a sentence is true. Or, put in other words, when a sentence corresponds to some actual way the world is, it's true. Otherwise, when the world is not the way a sentence says, there is no correspondence relation between a sentence and a world, and a sentence is false.

Here are some arguments for truthmakers.
First, the Correspondence Theory of Truth naturally leads to truthmakers. It's a specific thing in the world that propositions correspond to.
Second, truthmakers help us to distinguish between ideologically and ontologically distinct theories. Theories are ideologically distinct if they describe the world similarly but using different terminology. On the contrary, theories that describe the world differently, are ontologically distinct.
For example, there are two theories. The first one says that there are tomatoes and cucumbers. The second one claims that there are Solanum lycopersicums and Cucumis sativuses. Those theories simply use a different naming, so they are ideologically distinct.
Now take another two theories. The first one says that there are just bananas and oranges, and the second one insists on apples and mangoes. The world's ontology is different in those theories. So they are ontologically different.
Third, truthmakers can be employed to catch metaphysical cheaters. Here is what a dialogue with a metaphysical cheater, Vince, looks like:
Vince: - I believe that p is true.
Me: - Why?
Vince: - Because!
Vince is a cheater because he refuses to ground the truth of a proposition p.
